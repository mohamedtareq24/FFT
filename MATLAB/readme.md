These MATLAB files are used to model the the FFT archticure to be implemented on the FPGA and as a part of a future audio spectrum analyzer.
The files are used to understand the effect of the parameters and to detrmine the fixed point formatting needed
the simple FFT archticure is based on the following paper `https://www.researchgate.net/publication/235995761_The_Fast_Fourier_Transform_in_Hardware_A_Tutorial_Based_on_an_FPGA_Implementation`
